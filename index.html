            <p>I'm from California and moved up here for school about a year ago.
            </p>
            <p> I defintely hate the cold and miss 60 degree winters, but I'm enjoying
                my time up here at school.

            </p>
            <p>I love to hangout with my friends, I love working out, whether that be weight lifting or running, and I love to 
                learn more about Christ
            </p>
            <p>I think understanding the ins and outs of programming is really important.
                Firstly, we use the internet constantly, so having some idea of how it's built
                would benefit our day to day lives.
                Secondly, it seems that we're moving entirely to an electronic future, and 
                with programming jobs being opened up pretty much everywhere you look,
                makes this career a very attractive one in terms of the job market.
